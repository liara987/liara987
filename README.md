### 😁 About Me
Hi, I'm Liara! I graduated in 2019 and started my journey as a developer during the challenging times of the pandemic. Today, I'm focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem. I've built projects using Vue, React, Angular and Node. Beyond work, I run a YouTube channel where I share insights about technology and everything I learn along the way.

I'm curious and passionate for discovering new ideas and exploring innovative technologies.
Fun Fact: My journey began at 16 with my first job selling popsicles!
I enjoy immersing myself in anime and video games, as well as spending time with friends and exploring exciting new places.
