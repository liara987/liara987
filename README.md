## üòÅ About me
> **Hi, I'm a Software Engineer at [UOL](https://www.uol.com.br), I work as a front-end web developer, right now I use JavaScript on daily basis, but I worked with Typescript and Angular on past projects, and I really love those technologies.**
> 
> **Also, I'm really nerd, love to play games and watch Anime, and I'm a YouTuber, on my channel I like to talk about technology and teach some cool things I learn.** üòä
 
## üöÄ Projects I'm proud of
> - [Animes Online](https://github.com/liara987/animes-online-angular): This is a recent one, is a Angular page to watch anime, I learned some new things and is really exciting, I would like to add more features and improvements, while I grown my skills.
> 
> - [Crypto Index](https://github.com/liara987/desafio-trybe): This one is a small project but it was the first time I created something by myself, it was really challenging at the time, and I was really happy that I did.
